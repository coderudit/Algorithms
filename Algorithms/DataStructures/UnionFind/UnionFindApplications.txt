Terminologies
Union Find aka Disjoint Set data structure.
Parent node: The direct parent node of a vertex.
Root node: A node without a parent node; it can be viewed as the parent node of itself. Sometimes the root node is referred to as the head node.

The two important functions of Union Find.
The find function finds the root node of a given vertex.
The union function unions two vertices and makes their root nodes the same.

There are two ways to implement Union Find.
Quick Find: The time complexity of the find function will be O(1) However, the union function will take more time with the time complexity of O(N).
Quick Union: The time complexity of the union function is better. Meanwhile, the find function will take more time in this case.

Application of Union Find.
1. To determine if two people share a common ancestor.
